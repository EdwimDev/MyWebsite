<h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2> 
<p>Hi, I am <strong>Edwin Carlos Mateus Mulima</strong>. I'm a <strong>15-year-old Angolan teenager</strong> who is currently in the 9th Grade, and I aspire to be a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> when I grow up. I will become a Software Engineer because ever since I was a little kid, the way computers, apps, websites, games, and recently, AI work has always amazed me. That's when I knew this is exactly what I wanted to be. This is what I want to do with my life. The languages I can currently speak are Portuguese and English. I'm currently studying the base structure of websites, <strong>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)</strong> at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>. Coding is my comfort zone.</p>

<h2 class="objectives-title">My Objectives and Ambitions</h2> 
<p>I love learning about front-end coding, technology, and AI. Ever since I was little, websites like <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, games like <a href="https://www.minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>, and the way computers work have always amazed me. When I grow up, I plan to become a <strong>FullStack Engineer</strong>, being completely able to work with both <strong>FrontEnd and BackEnd</strong> to bring ideas to life through coding.</p>

<h2 class="interests-title">Personal Interests</h2> 
<p>Besides coding, I also enjoy watching videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and playing games like <a href="https://www.roblox.com" target="_blank">Roblox</a>, <a href="https://ff.garena.com" target="_blank">Garena Free Fire</a>, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com" target="_blank">Call Of Duty</a>, <a href="https://www.minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>, and <a href="https://warthunder.com" target="_blank">War Thunder</a>.</p>
